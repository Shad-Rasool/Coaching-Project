<b>Study and Discussion Rooms</b>
<br>
We understand the importance of collaborative learning. Our study and discussion rooms are designed to facilitate group work and peer-to-peer learning. These spaces are perfect for group projects, study sessions, and discussions, allowing students to share ideas and learn from each other in a supportive environment.
<br>
<b>Extracurricular Facilities</b>
<br>
At Square Classes, we believe in the holistic development of our students. Our extracurricular facilities include a sports complex, music room, and art studio. These spaces provide students with opportunities to pursue their interests and talents outside the classroom. Whether itâ€™s playing a sport, learning a musical instrument, or exploring their artistic side, our students have access to a wide range of activities that promote physical and mental well-being.
<br>
<b>Cafeteria and Lounge Areas</b>
<br>
A healthy mind needs a healthy body. Our cafeteria offers a variety of nutritious meals and snacks to keep students energized throughout the day. We also have lounge areas where students can relax and unwind between classes. These spaces are designed to create a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere, making Square Classes a home away from home.
<br>

One of the key features of Square Classes is our commitment to personalized learning. We maintain small class sizes to ensure that each student receives individual attention and tailored guidance. Our experienced faculty members are dedicated to understanding the unique needs of each student and providing the support they need to succeed. This personalized approach helps students build confidence and achieve their academic goals.
<br>
